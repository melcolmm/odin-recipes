    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This air fryer pork chop recipe is so simple with ranch seasoning mix and just 10 minutes in the air fryer. 
        I prefer my chops slightly pink to ensure juiciness, but feel free to add an extra minute on each side for well-done. 
        Try different varieties of ranch mix (like spicy or bacon) to change up the flavor.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 boneless, center-cut pork chops, 1-inch thick</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dry ranch salad dressing mix</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
        <li>Place pork chops onto a plate and lightly spray both sides with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle both sides with ranch seasoning mix and let sit at room temperature for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Spray an air fryer basket with cooking spray and preheat the air fryer to 390 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Working in batches if necessary to ensure they are not overcrowded, place chops into the preheated air fryer. 
            Cook for 10 minutes, flipping halfway through. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Transfer to a foil-covered plate and let sit for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
